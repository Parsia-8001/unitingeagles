									<h2>Welcome to Uniting Eagles!</h2>
									<p><strong>Uniting Eagles</strong> is a nonprofit organization providing mentoring programs for
									middle and high school youth in the Greater Metropolitan area. Uniting Eagles' goal is to foster
									a commitment to young people that will promote pro-social friendships, strong interpersonal
									skills, and reassert a sense of hope in the future. The program will form partnerships with
									local school districts and the Spanish Community. We hope to help the high school youth with
									college application assistance, on-the-job training, and internship assistance and placement.
									Only through personal relationships can a sense of individual responsibility be restablished
									that will give youth the commitment to follow through on path to adulthood with a sense of
									pride and accomplishment.</p>

									<h2>Why Uniting Eagles?</h2>
									<p>Through repeated failures in the classroom and the development of destructive habits,
										at-risk young people have lost faith in the possibilities that await them if they are
										successful in putting their lives together. To accomplish this goal, young people must
										be in a caring, inclusive learning environment that promotes their best effort and
										reinforces personal respect.</p>
									<p>Uniting Eagles is a program that is in direct response to the growing number of young
										people that are either falling through the cracks at school or are already entangled
										with the juvenile court system. The goal of the program is to identify youths who are
										going to have a turbulent transition to adulthood and offer a positive support system
										to avoid the pitfalls that can derail their lives. The focus is slightly different at
										each level but the goal remains the same; empower the young person to make positive
										changes in his/her life.</p>
									<p>Uniting Eagles will focus primarily on middle school youths. It is projected that
										within three years, 50% of the system's students will be in middle school. This age
										group is particularly problematic and a perfect time for mentoring to be effective.</p>
									<p>Uniting Eagles mentoring programs will pair a youth with a mentor for 12 months. During
										that time the two will participate in weekly planned activities to strengthen the
										relationship between the two and improve the young person's confidence and hopefulness.
										Mentors will receive continuous training throughout the year and will participate in
										monthly meetings to report the young person's progress.</p>
									<p>Over time, Uniting Eagles will create a learning environment that will be an
										invaluable resource to young people, aspiring mentors and the community at large.</p>
