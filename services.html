									<h3><strong>Uniting Eagles</strong> offers youth that have already been identified as at-risk, an opportunity to work with a caring mentor to improve their ability lives and to develop a positive attitude towards their future. The long-term goal of Uniting Eagles is to empower the young person to break the habits that are leading to trouble in school and in the streets.</h3>
									<h3>Uniting Eagles has six (6) mentoring programs. They are as follows:</h3>
									<li><strong>E-Progenis:</strong> E-Leaders is the focus program of our Uniting Eagles. At-risk middle and high school students and their mentors participate in a structured program of support. Problem middle and high school students and their mentors participate in an energizing retreat, followed by a six month structured program that includes monthly group team-building and group activities. The program ends with a graduation celebration, but the mentor and youth remain together for the following six months.</li>
									<br />
									<li><strong>E-Leaders:</strong> E-Leaders is the most exciting program of Unite for Youth. Honor middle school and High School students and their mentors participate in a structured program of support. All school students and their mentors participate in an energizing retreat, followed by a six month structured program that includes monthly group team-building and group activities. The program ends with a graduation celebration, but the mentor and youth remain together for the following six months.</li>
									<br />
									<li><strong>E-Catalyst:</strong> The E-Catalyst program focuses on students who are chronically suspended from middle and high schools. The goal of the program is to rekindle the youth's commitment to learning and being successful in the classroom. By empowering young people to finish school, mentors are improving the student's success in the work world as adults.</li>
									<br />
									<li><strong>E-Born Again:</strong> The E-Born Again program engages youth involved in the juvenile court system. The mentoring relationship is utilized to establish a program of change in the young person's life. The mentor encourages goal-setting, self-discipline, and skill development that improves the young person's sense of hopefulness. Mentors and youth work one-on-one for a year and are also offered opportunities to participate in monthly group activities and outings.</li>
									<br />
									<li><strong>E-Friends:</strong> The E-Friends program works with children from local elementary schools. Adult mentors come to school each week to have lunch with their "friend." The program lasts for the duration of the school year.</li>
									<br />
									<li><strong>E-Dreamers:</strong> The E-Dreamers helps youth that need guidance with college enrollment and career options for those that have processed their paperwork that Immigration needs.  We will also help the E-Dreamers with their Immigration applications. </li>
									<br />
									<li><strong>E-Discovery</strong> The E-Discovery program helps Youth that would like to participate with classes in the IT field and on-the-job training..</li>
